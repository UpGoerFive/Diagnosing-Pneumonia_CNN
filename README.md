## Overview
It was recently found that most of the children hospitalized are having pneumonia in the period from January 2013 to June 2019 that pushed the government in China to perform a chest x-ray for all hospitalized children to check whether they are normal or have pneumonia. It was recommended to build a neural network model which helps to decide whether the child has pneumonia or not from the chest x-rays in a quick way that helps the physicians.

## Stakeholder
As a leading health care agency in Guangzhou, China, the Health Department in China continues to play a critical role by checking chest x-ray for children hospitalized. Our project, presentation, and machine learning model were created for use by the Health Department in China’s government.

## The Business Problem 
The goal is to build a model with high accuracy that classifies any Chest X-ray whether it is NORMAL or PNEUMONIA to help the physician to get the correct diagnosis in no time.

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) of the dataset were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

The effectiveness of this classification model will be measured by how well it predicts the PNEUMONIA case and the Normal case.

## Analysis Questions 
- Are the images for the chest X-rays are clear enough to build a model?
- Are the two classes (Normal & Pneumonia) imbalanced or balanced?
