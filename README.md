## Overview

## The Business Problem 
The goal is to build a model with high accuracy that classifies any Chest X-ray whether it is NORMAL or PNEUMONIA to help the physician to get the correct diagnosis in no time.

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) of the dataset were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

The effectiveness of this classification model will be measured by how well it predicts the PNEUMONIA case and the Normal case.

## Analysis Questions 
- Are the images for the chest X-rays are clear enough to build a model?
- Are the two classes (Normal & Pneumonia) imbalanced or balanced?
